Our task was to automate the mine detection process. In order to do this,\n        we were given several dozen sets of sonar/video feed sequences, each consisting of several minutes of\n        mine-seeking until a mine was eventually spotted. After creating training data by assigning mine/no mine labels to the entire dataset, it was time to train some models.\n\n        <br /><br />\n        We expected that a simple image classification approach would suffice for the \n        video data, since upon visual inspection of the video data the mines were fairly easy to discern with the human eye. \n        Our approach was to utilize the image representations learned by Inception [1], a CNN that had been trained for classifcation on a \n        large natural image dataset, by retraining it on our mine sweeping video data. As expected,\n        we achieved accuracy ratings in the upper 90s. \n\n        <br /><br />\n        However, mines were only visible up close in the video data. To spot mines from farther away, \n        the sonar data would need to be utilized. When we tried employing the same strategy as with the video data,\n        the network performed about as well as a random classification strategy. It was essentially a garbage-in-garbage-out situation. So,\n        the key to achieving accurate results turned out to be two preprocessing steps unique to this domain.\n        \n        <br /><br />\n        First, instead of presenting the sonar images in polar coordinates to the network, \n        we transformed them to cartesian space, which allows the convolutional structures and features captured by the network\n        to operate on images more closely resembling the natural images it was pre-trained on.  \n        <br /><br />\n        Second, we utilized pose information of the submarine to align sequences of sonar images\n        instead of looking at them in isolation. By doing this, we were able to drastically reduce the \n        noise present in the sonar data.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Taken together, these two preprocessing steps allowed us to train the network to achieve accuracy in the low 90s for the sonar\n        data.\n\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <h2>References</h2>\n        [1] C.
