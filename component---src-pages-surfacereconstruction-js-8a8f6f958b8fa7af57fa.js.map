Ideally, we would like to construct a watertight mesh, whose \n        geometry, texture, and colors are faithful to the real thing. \n        \n        <br/><br/>\n        Here, I'm going to talk about just the geometry\n        part, which is referred to as <i>surface reconstruction</i>, and is a well-studied and arguably \"solved\" problem in the literature [1].\n        <br/><br/>\n        Meshing individual scans in the sequence is easy, since the perspective used to capture each point cloud \n        naturally imposes a lattice structure, which can be directly iterated through, forming triangles when the maximum\n        side length is under some threshold.\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"two\">\n        The real challenge arises when attempting to merge each individually meshed scan into a single mesh, as there will be\n        overlap in regions that are captured by multiple scans, which must be resolved for the model to be commercially usable:\n        <br /><br />\n\n        <div className=\"image center\">\n             <img src={bplant_overlap} width=\"80%\"></img>\n             </div>\n        <br /><br />\n\n        The literature offers two main ways to tackle this issue. The first is to actually ignore the\n        lattice structure described above, and perform meshing on the entire point cloud containing all measured points\n        directly. While this does throw away information, in some instances it can work well. In particular, variants of Poisson reconstruction [2,3]\n        can achieve extremely accurate results in cases <i>where all surfaces of the object are observed</i>. In cases of completely absent data for certain regions,\n        such as the underside of the leaves in a top-down view of our banana plant, Poisson reconstruction will fail in rather disturbing fashion:\n        <br />\n        <br />        \n        <div className=\"image center\">\n             <img src={bplant2} width=\"80%\"></img>\n             </div>\n        <br /><br />\n\n        These phantom \"bubbles\" are the result of Poisson reconstruction's (elegant) treatment of the problem as the optimization of a watertight surface whose surface was sampled\n        to produce the scanned point clouds. <br/><br />\n\n        The second family of methods in the literature for handling sets of point clouds collected from differing perspectives treats the problem more directly by growing the mesh\n        at a local level, as opposed to optimizing for a global objective.\n        In particular, the <i>Zippering</i> approach of Turk et. al. [4] meshes the scans individually and then performs decimation in overlapping areas.  This would be an ideal solution, except computationally it does not scale well to the higher resolutions 3co works with. To \n        address this issue, Meerits et. al. [5] have reformulated the algorithm to be GPU-friendly, potentially making it computationally viable for higher resolutions. Unfortunately, their code is\n        not publically available for testing, and their results do not appear to construct models at the level of accuracy needed for commercially usable 3D models.\n\n        <br/><br/>\n        In the end, the best approach for this setting seems to be <i>VRIP</i>, contributed by Curless et. al.[6]. VRIP utilizes the lattice structure of \n        each scan's observations, but instead of individually meshing scans and then merging them, VRIP iterates across voxels in a volumetric representation of the object in an efficient\n        manner that accounts for the knowledge of where free space is given the persective of the scanner across time. An implementation of VRIP with minor extensions called VCG is conveniently included in \n        <a href=\"meshlab.net\"> MeshLab </a>[7], and with a subsequent final step of applying <a href=\"https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/instant-meshes/\">Instant Meshes</a> [8] for compression and clean-up, we get the following quite usable result: <br /><br />\n\n\n\n        <div className=\"image center\">\n             <img src={bplant1} width=\"80%\"></img>\n             </div>\n\n        </section>\n\n\n           \n        \n\n\n       \n    <br /><br />\n    <h2> References</h2>\n    [1] Matthew Berger, Andrea Tagliasacchi, Lee Seversky, Pierre Alliez, Gael Guennebaud, et al..
